# Admin Authentication Separation - Solution

## Problem
When users logout from the main website, the admin panel (Filament) also gets logged out automatically. This happens because both systems were sharing the same session and the logout process was invalidating the entire session.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the logout controllers where `$request->session()->invalidate()` was being called, which destroys the entire session including admin authentication data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Authentication Guards Configuration
The system already had separate guards configured in `config/auth.php`:
- `web` guard for main website users
- `admin` guard for admin panel users

### 2. Filament Configuration
Filament is properly configured to use the `admin` guard in `AdminPanelProvider.php`:
```php
->authGuard('admin')
```

### 3. Fixed Logout Controllers

#### AuthenticatedSessionController.php
**Before:**
```php
public function destroy(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    Auth::guard('web')->logout();
    $request->session()->invalidate(); // This was the problem!
    $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    return redirect('/');
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function destroy(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    // Only logout from web guard, don't invalidate entire session
    Auth::guard('web')->logout();
    
    // Don't invalidate session to preserve admin login
    // Only regenerate token for security
    $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    
    return redirect('/');
}
```

#### ProfileController.php
**Before:**
```php
public function destroy(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    // ... validation code ...
    Auth::logout();
    $user->delete();
    $request->session()->invalidate(); // This was also problematic!
    $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    return Redirect::to('/');
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function destroy(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    // ... validation code ...
    // Only logout from web guard, don't invalidate entire session
    Auth::guard('web')->logout();
    $user->delete();
    
    // Don't invalidate session to preserve admin login
    $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    
    return Redirect::to('/');
}
```

### 4. Admin-Specific Logout
The admin panel has its own logout handler in `app/Filament/Pages/Auth/Logout.php`:
```php
public function toResponse($request)
{
    // Logout from admin guard only
    Auth::guard('admin')->logout();
    
    // Invalidate the session
    $request->session()->invalidate();
    $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    
    // Redirect to admin login page
    return redirect()->route('filament.admin.auth.login');
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Web User Logout:
1. User clicks logout on main website
2. Only `Auth::guard('web')->logout()` is called
3. Session token is regenerated for security
4. Session data remains intact
5. Admin stays logged in

### Admin User Logout:
1. Admin clicks logout in admin panel
2. Only `Auth::guard('admin')->logout()` is called
3. Session is invalidated (admin-specific)
4. Redirected to admin login page

### Account Deletion:
1. User deletes their account
2. Only `Auth::guard('web')->logout()` is called
3. User account is deleted
4. Session token is regenerated
5. Admin stays logged in

## Benefits

1. **Independent Authentication**: Web and admin authentication are completely separate
2. **Security**: Each guard maintains its own authentication state
3. **User Experience**: Admins don't get logged out when managing the website
4. **Session Management**: Proper session handling without conflicts

## Testing

To test the solution:

1. **Login as admin** in `/admin`
2. **Login as regular user** in main website
3. **Logout from main website** - admin should remain logged in
4. **Logout from admin panel** - only admin gets logged out
5. **Delete user account** - admin should remain logged in

## Security Considerations

- Session tokens are still regenerated on logout for security
- Each guard maintains separate authentication state
- Admin authentication requires specific privileges
- Session data is preserved only when necessary

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`
2. `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php`

## Files Already Configured (No Changes Needed)

1. `config/auth.php` - Guards configuration
2. `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php` - Filament guard configuration
3. `app/Filament/Pages/Auth/Login.php` - Admin login handler
4. `app/Filament/Pages/Auth/Logout.php` - Admin logout handler
5. `app/Http/Middleware/FilamentAdminAuth.php` - Admin authentication middleware
