BEFORE UPLOADING:
□ Update APP_URL in .env to your domain (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
□ Set APP_ENV=production in .env
□ Set APP_DEBUG=false in .env
□ Generate new APP_KEY if needed: php artisan key:generate

FILES TO UPLOAD:
□ All files in storage/app/public/products/ (30 files)
□ All files in storage/app/public/payment_proofs/ (32 files)
□ All files in public/images/ (13 files)
□ hosting-setup.sh script
□ .htaccess-images file

AFTER UPLOADING:
□ Run: chmod +x hosting-setup.sh
□ Run: ./hosting-setup.sh
□ Test image URLs:
  - Product images: https://yourdomain.com/storage/products/[filename]
  - Payment proofs: https://yourdomain.com/storage/payment_proofs/[filename]

TESTING:
□ Visit admin panel: https://yourdomain.com/admin
□ Check product images in admin/products
□ Check payment proof images in admin/orders
□ Test image uploads
□ Test frontend product display

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If images don't show:
1. Check storage link: ls -la public/storage
2. Check permissions: ls -la storage/app/public/
3. Check .env APP_URL setting
4. Clear cache: php artisan config:clear
5. Recreate storage link: php artisan storage:link

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
□ Copy .htaccess-images content to main .htaccess
□ Enable gzip compression for images
□ Consider using CDN for images
□ Optimize image sizes if needed
